\begin{lstlisting}
Root folder of the source code belonging to the doctoral thesis:

and master thesis:

"Computing the Spectrum of the Confined Hydrogen Atom", Karl K\"astner, 2012.

Installation instructions:
	
1) Install Matlab
2) Install subversion (svn) and add subversion to the search path, so that
   it can be called from Matlab
3) Checkout this umbrella-project:
   svn checkout https://github.com/karlkastner/root/trunk root/
4) Start Matlab
5) Change into this directory ('root/')
6) Run the Matlab script "startup" located in this directory

The script then fetches the sub-repositories and adds them to the
Matlab search path
	
Note:

The code upload is work in progress, more parts will be subsequently
documented, added and tested.

This is experimental code. Use it wisely and at your own risk.
